Tracking implications of a Dominion League match

This project contains three modules:
 - domimpl.py: the main module, containing functions to manipulate a standings matrix
 - file_read.py: a module containing functions to read standings matrices from files. Currently, only supports DomBot's match output
 - img_draw.py: a module containing functions that draw the images.

This project requires Pandas and Pillow.
